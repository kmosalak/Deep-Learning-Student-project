This is a student analysis project done for my deep learning assignment at UCSC. There are 4 files - 
1. for a basic RGB color analysis for a set of 10 choosen channels, 
2. for image pixel analysis using tensors, 
3. Uses Ressnet-50 and 
4. Uses vgg16 analysis for the same images.

To run these files please setup the following libraries : 

pip install torch torchvision scikit-learn python-youtube

You will also need PyTorch, numpy, matplotlib to name a few.
